#-- My Garage Door -------------------------
#-------------------------------------------
#
# My garage door is very simple. If you are
# outside, you have to open it with a key.
# When you are inside you can open it from
# within the car by pulling a rope. 
#
# Features
#   - The door will open when a key event or
#     a rope pull event happens
#   - When it opens it will move up until it
#     reaches its end position.
#   - When it closes it will move down until
#     it reaches its end position.
#   - While the door is moving (up or down)
#     a lamp is blinking, signaling the
#     driver to not drive yet
#   - When the door is fully open, or fully
#     closed the light will switch off
#   - When the door is fully open a timer is
#     started
#   - When the door is open and the timer
#     expires, then the door will start to
#     move down
#   - When the door is moving down, a key or
#     rope event will stop the downwards
#     movement and the door will start to
#     move upwards again (opening)
