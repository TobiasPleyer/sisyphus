-- My Garage Door -------------------------
-------------------------------------------

My garage door is very simple. If you are
outside, you have to open it with a key.
When you are inside you can open it from
within the car by pulling a rope. 

Features
  - The door will open when a key event or
    a rope pull event happens
  - When it opens it will move up until it
    reaches its end position.
  - When it closes it will move down until
    it reaches its end position.
  - While the door is moving (up or down)
    a lamp is blinking, signaling the
    driver to not drive yet
  - When the door is fully open, or fully
    closed the light will switch off
  - When the door is fully open a timer is
    started
  - When the door is open and the timer
    expires, then the door will start to
    move down
  - When the door is moving down, a key or
    rope event will stop the downwards
    movement and the door will start to
    move upwards again (opening)
